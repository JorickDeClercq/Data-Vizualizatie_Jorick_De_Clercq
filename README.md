# Datavisualisation
## Assignment1 : Lost potential
**Proces**
  
I wanted to know how many people died in the 2nd World War. I kept my poster fairly simple because I wanted to keep the message of the data as clear as possible. The message of the data is so powerful that I did not want to change this much.  
  
**Goal**  
  
Visualize the top 10 countries on criteria of the number of victims of World War 2. Make a clear distinction between soldiers, civilians and people who died in the Holocaust.  
  
**Properties**
  
Intent: A.1 Explanatory
  
Appearance: A.2 Static
  
**Result**  
A simple bar chart where the 10 countries get up with the most victims of World War 2. The victims are divided into civilians, soldiers and people who died in the Holocaust.  
  
## Assignment2 : final voyage  
**Proces**  
  
I have a great interest in the 2nd World War. Not only do the thoughts bring up tears for all victims but also a certain admiration for the engineering accomplishment every country has accomplished. At this time a country was not measured on the basis of how large their army was but how many battleships they had. So i wanted to make a data visualization around battleships.  
  
**Goal**  
  
Show on a map where battleships have sunk and how many people have died from the ship.  
  
**Properties**  
  
Intent: A.1 Exploratory
  
Appearance: A.2 Interactive
  
Other: A.x D3  
  
**Result**  
  
A world map where all battleships are depicted on the spot that they have sunk. You can see the name of the ship as well as the date that it was sunk and the number of deaths.  
  
## Assignment3 : Can you spot it?
**Proces**  
  
I found a project from someone who generated 3d maps with a view of where you encounter a certain kind of deer. I thought this was such a cool idea that I used his code written in R and generated my own models.  
  
**Goal**  
  
Create a 3D map where you can see where you can encounter a brown bear and how likely it is you encounter one.  
  
**Properties**  
  
Intent: A.1 Exploratory
  
Media: B Physical
  
Appearance: A.2 Static
  
Other: A.x 3D  
  
**Result**  
  
A 3D printed map of North America where you can see on the basis of encounters where you can come across a brown bear. The height correlates how likely it is that you encounter a brown bear.  
  
## Assignment4 :  Fairytale Of New York
**Proces**  
  
I found a dataset of the number of people arrested in the counties of New York. These were dated from 1970 to 2017. I was wondering if this amound was increased or not so I made a video of it with nodebox and premierePro.  
  
**Goal**  
  
Create a linear video which compares the amount of arrests by province of New York starting from 1970.  
  
**Properties**  
  
Intent: A.1 Explanatory
  
Appearance: A.2 Linear
  
Other: A.x Node-based  
  
**Result**  
  
Assignment 4 is a video, which show shows everything arrests of each year, starting 1970 up until 2017. And compares the amount of arrests of each county.
