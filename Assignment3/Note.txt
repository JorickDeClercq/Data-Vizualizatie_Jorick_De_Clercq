Assignment3 : Can you spot it?

Proces
I found a project from someone who generated 3d maps with a view of where you encounter a certain kind of deer. 
I thought this was such a cool idea that I used his code written in R and generated my own models.

Goal
Create a 3D map where you can see where you can encounter a brown bear and how likely it is you encounter one.

Properties
Intent: A.1 Exploratory

Media: B Physical

Appearance: A.2 Static

Other: A.x 3D

Result
A 3D printed map of North America where you can see on the basis of encounters where you can come across a brown bear. 
The height correlates how likely it is that you encounter a brown bear.
