Assignment2 : final voyage

Proces
I have a great interest in the 2nd World War. Not only do the thoughts bring up tears for all victims but also a certain admiration for the  engineering accomplishment every country has accomplished. At this time a country was not measured on how large their army was but how many  battleships they had. So i wanted to make a data visualization around battleships.

Goal
Show on a map where battleships have sunk and how many people have died from the ship.

Properties
Intent: A.1 Exploratory

Appearance: A.2 Interactive

Other: A.x D3

Result
A world map where all battleships are depicted on the spot that they have sunk. You can see the name of the ship as well as the date that   it was sunk and the number of deaths.
